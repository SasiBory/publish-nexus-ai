Analyze the following ASIN: {{asin}}

Provide the following information:

- Product Overview: A detailed overview of the product.
- Conversion Metrics: Key conversion metrics for the product.
- Comparable Products: A list of comparable products and their key features.
- Derived Keywords: A list of at least 15 keywords derived from the product listing and comparable products. For each keyword, provide an estimated monthly search volume and a competition level (Baja, Media, o Alta).
- Strategic Weakness: This is the most critical part. Based on all the data above, provide:
    - **Identified Weakness:** Pinpoint the single most significant strategic weakness of this product. Look for patterns in negative reviews, a suboptimal cover, a high price, or a poorly optimized title/description.
    - **Exploitation Plan:** Provide a clear, actionable plan for a new author to exploit this weakness and launch a superior competing product.`,
